# -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
# This code is a proof-of-concept of a simple testing library.
# It comes with no warranty (and no tests) and is guaranteed to 
# be broken in more ways than a teenager's heart. Use at your own risk.
#
# This code is unsupported. Requests for changes, bug reports, 
# and patches will be silently but brutally ignored.
